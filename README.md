## What I learned from this project

- More advanced usage of JS modules and Webpack.
- Building a user interface without separate input forms (forms make up the interface).
- Building an autosave feature for user inputs.
- Storing and retrieving objects (with functions attached) to and from local storage.
- How to sort and display items based on criteria such as due date and priority.
